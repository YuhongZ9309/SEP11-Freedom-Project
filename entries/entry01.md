# Entry 1

Deciding on what topic to focus on was a hard choice for me. I have thought of many ideas that I can use in the Freedom Project, but I was not sure that if I wanted to focus on that topic the whole year. I was juggling whether doing the history of computers or looking into the science and technologies behind Virtual Reality. As the deadline approaches, I decided to settle on the idea of researching about VPNs and learning how to make one. 
	During the planning stage, I wanted to make the Freedom Project worth the whole year’s commitment to. I wanted a topic where I can stick to it for a whole year and I still will not get tired of. I didn’t want to research the history of some technology because I know that I will get tired of researching and I will eventually lose all my motivation. Instead, I want to try something new and decided to try to make something along this journey. 
VPNs are something very crucial to ensure your network’s safety and as well as trying to access blocked content. Getting more technical, I’ve found resources such as
https://www.howtogeek.com/133680/htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn/ and https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/security-essentials/explain-how-vpn-works. I will use these resources to help me write the first page explaining the Whats and the Whys of a VPN. 
	Getting onto the fun part of the project, I will attempt to make my own VPN server on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. Instead of just explaining the importance of a VPN, why not include more fun and attempt to make one? I will use resources like https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/raspberry-pi-vpn/ and maybe some YouTube videos if I ever encounter any issues. 
	Throughout this project, my personal goal is to learn more about VPNs and how they work. I want to be able to create my own VPN server and also expand my knowledge of using a Raspberry Pi. Nevertheless, my main goal of this project is to gather the necessary skills to craft a beautiful website projecting all the information that I will learn.
